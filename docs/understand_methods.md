# Tutorial: Understanding Methods

## Preparation

In advance of the tutorial, you need to decide which of your published papers you are going to use as a focus of these activities, see below for crtieria. 

## Context

This tutorial supports the module _Psychological influences on health and behaviour_. Despite the name, about half the module is dedicated to developing basic psychological research skills. Students in this module work in a group to do a small research project. At the end of the module, they will present their poster and receive a mark for it (60% of their module). 

## Overview

In this tutorial, students should familiarise themselves with and understand a method section of a psychology article. You should help them understand how the experiment happened, and help them to understand the ethical issues surrounding the running of the study / collection and storage of the data (etc).

Later in the module they will learn about 3 kinds of design, and they will have to pick one for their group study.  

1. A correlational study (linking a psychometric test with an outcome)

1. An experimental study (comparing conditions A and B on a measure)

1. A quasi-experimental study (comparing pre-existing groups A and B on a measure).

Note 1: they will **not** necessarily be running this study in their tutorial group, so you may not be able to discuss a "single" study with the group.
  
## Tutorial plan

### Checking-in 

_5 minutes_

Students arrive, settle down, faff, etc. Say hello to them and ask them how they are, how they found their lectures etc.  

### Find your tutor’s paper

_20 minutes_

The goal of this task is for students to find one of your articles and familiarise themselves with the methods section. Ideally, you will use one of your articles that uses behavioural methods that will make sense to these **Foundation** students.  Steer them away from unnecessarily complex methods. If this isn't possible, select suitable papers from the literature that you feel comfortable discussing (and adjust the section below as appropriate). The important thing here is that the students get a sense of what research involves and what they are going to have to do in this module.

1. Depending on your attendance, separate them into groups of 2-3.

1. You can either let them choose one of your articles or you can give them one of your choosing.  

1. Ask them to read the method section and note any unfamiliar words (e.g., research jargon, abbreviations). If it helps, they can ask you straight away what the research terms mean (e.g., what is counterbalancing?)

1. At the same time, get them to write down what happened in the experiment. Encourage them to number the steps of the procedure (e.g., 1 - Participants came to the lab and were greeted by the experimenter; 2 - They read the brief, etc..).  

1. Get them to consider any potential ethical issues that might have arisen in the research (and how it was dealt with).

### Discuss the method section

_20 minutes_

The goal of this task is to practice talking about research and understand how it happened in the first place (i.e., the practical side of research). Approach them as if they would be trying to replicate your research and tell them the struggles and the practicalities of doing research (e.g., getting participants or ethics approval, making software work).   Get them to consider the steps that are often implicit and not clearly covered in a "formal" method section  (counterbalancing the materials, pilot work, agreeing a scoring protocol , dealing with participants questions, etc).  

1. Get them to describe the research method to you. Correct them if they missed something or misunderstood.  

1. Tell them how the research actually happened, including any issues. Maybe it was hard to find participants for your experiment or they misunderstood the task instructions? Talk about some of the practicalities (how long did it take? How much pilot work was needed, where do the materials come from? etc) . Perhaps the study was mostly run by your collaborators? In which case, tell them how collaborations happen.

1.If you haven’t explained yet, let them ask you what the unfamiliar words mean.

1. If there is time, tell them what the results were of this study. Most of them are unfamiliar with the stats hence giving them the basic overview should be enough.

1. Foreshadow what will be happening later in the module.Tell them that they will be doing group projects with support from the lectures / workshops, but that they need to think of the ethical and practical aspects sooner rather than later. Talk about the importance of sticking to the timetable. Ask how they will ensure this happens in their groups. Deal with any anxieties that arise.

## Extension activities

If you have spare time in the end, you can either finish early, let the students mingle, or do this extra activity:

- To discuss how and why researchers report their methods in a particular format, watch this video of the [exact instructions challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDA3_5982h8) (if you haven’t already).
