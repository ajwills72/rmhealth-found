# Personality and psychometrics

Tim's lecture, given I have to do the ethics stuff as well, is a full use of the session. 


## Sonja's lecture

Overall, there's some useful information here, but also a lot that can be cut. 

No reading set.

Personality as a good thing for a quick project.

Traits - typically like, and motivation.

16 personality types - Jung
PEN-model - Eysenck (somewhat clinical)
Big Five / Five factor - added openness to experience, psycho -> agreeable / conscientious (so 3->5)
HEXACO - Added a 6th Honesty/humilty.
(isn't this in earlier modules?) 

+ve psychology - happiness, and meaningful life. 
Character strengths - humour, creativity (24 of)
Balance - not just clinical, but improvement (-6 to 0; 0 to 6)

Name calls - psychological wellbeing; subjective well-being; 

broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions - that positive emotions in the moment lead to more openness, creativity, bring others to a happier state.

VIA classification (24 character strengths)

PERMA - Positve-emotions, Engagement (flow), positive Relationships, Meaning, Achievement (in the sense of achieving what you want to achieve)

How to find suitable measures?

- Myers Briggs is psychometrically poor. Googling is unreliable
- Make up your own measures.

How to part 2

- Searching tests on the BPS (have to be a member, really, and you have to pay for the tests themselves,  probably skip this )
- Searching PsycINFO ?!? (OMG, this is fairly poor)

- This is really good, though: https://ipip.ori.org/ 

How to select suitable measures - A bunch of fairly common-sense advice.

Psychometric properties:

- objectivity: standard procedure for running and scoring.
- reliability: (test re-test)
- validity: (relevance !?!)
- fairness: (across populations)
- usability (ease of use for participant and researchers)
- availabilty (including cost)
- (follow the instructions!)

Five methods (well, actually four...)

1. Questionnaires

- Items / questionnaires. Likert, yes/no
- self or other reported

2. Behaviour observations

- Accidental/spontaneous, or systematic

3. Momentary assessments (Experience sampling)

- to capture naturally occurring behaviour in people's daily lives

4. Objective life outcomes

- consequences of many aggregated behaviours over time that stem from personality.

Personality questionnaires

- NEO-PI-R : five facotr, 300 items, 
- HEXACO-PI : 6 factos, 192 items

Plus a bunch that are free to use for research

Positive psychology questionniares

- Same goes

Self-report and other report

Mentimeter quiz

Pair discussion & feedback
This exercise is a bit pointless.

Behaviour observations

- Facial coding system (FACS)
- Torrance test of creative thinking

Life outcomes

extraversion - spending more time with others
conscientiousness - health behaviours; clean & tidy room
nature connectedness

| 0:18 |          | Reliability + validity (2 slides) | 
| 0:21 |          | A crucial point... |
| 0:22 |          | What it can measure |
| 0:23 |          | Remember this slide? |
| 0:24 |          | How could we develop... (we could also add Sonja's bits here)
| 0:25 |          | Back to reliability (some discussion) |
| 0:31 |          | Scatterplots and correlations (two slides) |
| 0:33 |          | Correlations values | 
| 0:33 |          | Positive versus negative correlations |
| 0:35 |          | Some limitations of simple correlations |
| 0:36 |          | Activity 1 | 
| 0:39 |          | Correlations only measure linear relationships |
| 0:41 |          | Effects of restriction of range | 
| 0:42 |          | Effects of extreme values |
| 0:44 |          | Spontaneous questions |
| 0:46 |          | Break |
| 0:48 |          | Reliability of multiple-item scale | 
| 0:49 |          | Increasing the reliability of a measure |
| 0:51 |          | What if we take multiple measures (which is why personality tests have so many questions) |
| 0:54 |          | If you have enough measures, you get an accurate reading |
| 0:56 |          | The law of small numbers (2 slides) |
| 0:58 |          | In the example on the next slide |
| 0:59 |          | Small samples likely to give more extreme estimates of true average |
| 1:00 |          | This is why we should be wary of media reports like this (London rather than St. Ives, Colchester) | 
| 1:01 |          | Another more serious example |
| 1:02 |          | Plot of raes of cancer, based on population |
| 1:03 |          | 2011 BBC The wisdom of the crowd (N=160) |
| 1:08 |          | Wisdom of the (large) crowd (2 slides) |
| 1:10 |          | 3 thermometers - Activity (and hence dropping a question in a questionnaire) |
| 1:13 |          | What is the difference between these 2 scenarios? (not even agreeing with itself - T3 isn't even reliable). THis is the difference between reliabliity and (a type of) validity |
| 1:15 |          | Validity |
| 1:15 |          | Face validity | 
| 1:16 |          | Imagine a paper is folded - activity - it's number 3 |
| 1:18 |          | Content validity | 
| 1:20 |          | Predictive validity |
| 1:21 |          | Discriminant validity |
| 1:22 |          | Improving validity | 
| 1:24 |          | Imagine this was the outcome | 
| 1:26 |          | The use of psychometric tests in job selection | 
| 1:28 |          | Problem 1 |
| 1:29 |          | Problem 2 |
| 1:30 |          | Problem 3 |
| 1:31 |          | Selection issues with tests that vary in validity |
| 1:33 |          | Selection issues: criterion |

...and it seems to end there. Rather abruptly.


- Chapter 4

Activity 1: x: age of children. y: height of children. What correlation do you expect to find? (out of the 5) - It depends on the range!
Does confidence predict accuracy of witness? (well, it depends on the range)

Thoughts - the dinosaur in the scatterplot!
