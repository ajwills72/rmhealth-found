Personality as a good thing for a quick project.

Traits - typically like, and motivation.

16 personality types - Jung
PEN-model - Eysenck (somewhat clinical)
Big Five / Five factor - added openness to experience, psycho -> agreeable / conscientious (so 3->5)
HEXACO - Added a 6th Honesty/humilty.
(isn't this in earlier modules?) 

+ve psychology - happiness, and meaningful life. 
Character strengths - humour, creativity (24 of)
Balance - not just clinical, but improvement (-6 to 0; 0 to 6)

Name calls - psychological wellbeing; subjective well-being; 

broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions - that positive emotions in the moment lead to more openness, creativity, bring others to a happier state.

VIA classification (24 character strengths)

PERMA - Positve-emotions, Engagement (flow), positive Relationships, Meaning, Achievement (in the sense of achieving what you want to achieve)

How to find suitable measures?

- Myers Briggs is psychometrically poor. Googling is unreliable
- Make up your own measures.

How to part 2

- Searching tests on the BPS (have to be a member, really, and you have to pay for the tests themselves,  probably skip this )
- Searching PsycINFO ?!? (OMG, this is fairly poor)

- This is really good, though: https://ipip.ori.org/ 

How to select suitable measures - A bunch of fairly common-sense advice.

Psychometric properties:

- objectivity: standard procedure for running and scoring.
- reliability: (test re-test)
- validity: (relevance !?!)
- fairness: (across populations)
- usability (ease of use for participant and researchers)
- availabilty (including cost)
- (follow the instructions!)

Five methods (well, actually four...)

1. Questionnaires

- Items / questionnaires. Likert, yes/no
- self or other reported

2. Behaviour observations

- Accidental/spontaneous, or systematic

3. Momentary assessments (Experience sampling)

- to capture naturally occurring behaviour in people's daily lives

4. Objective life outcomes

- consequences of many aggregated behaviours over time that stem from personality.

Personality questionnaires

- NEO-PI-R : five facotr, 300 items, 
- HEXACO-PI : 6 factos, 192 items

Plus a bunch that are free to use for research

Positive psychology questionniares

- Same goes

Self-report and other report

Mentimeter quiz

Pair discussion & feedback
This exercise is a bit pointless.

Behaviour observations

- Facial coding system (FACS)
- Torrance test of creative thinking

Life outcomes

extraversion - spending more time with others
conscientiousness - health behaviours; clean & tidy room
nature connectedness

| 1:33 |    2     | Selection issues: criterion |

...and it seems to end there. Rather abruptly.


- Chapter 4

Activity 1: x: age of children. y: height of children. What correlation do you expect to find? (out of the 5) - It depends on the range!
Does confidence predict accuracy of witness? (well, it depends on the range)

Thoughts - the dinosaur in the scatterplot!
