1. _Group name, and names of all members of the group_: EXAMPLE PROPOSAL

2. _Project title_: Do smokers and non-smokers differ in their tolerance of distressing images of health risks?  

3. _What target sample will you use, and how will you recruit them?_ We will recruit students who self-report as smokers or non-smokers, currently registered on PSYC003, and we will recruit them face-to-face during workshop sessions

4. _Give a brief outline of your procedure:_ Participants will be told that they will see a series of images taken from cigarette packets showing the negative outcomes of smoking. For each image they will be asked to rate how distressing they find the image (from not at all, to extremely). We will then compare the ratings for the smokers and non-smokers.
