# Ethics and materials workshop

The main purpose of this workshop is to get the students to commit to a specific project, and once they have done that to:

1. Complete an ethics form. 
2. Begin the process of developing the materials.  

## Activity 1 (probably most of the workshop)

Get students to start working on their ethics form. I expect that this will be a relatively short document (1-2 pages), but that is clearly signals what they are going to do, and it allows us to get a handle on whether there are any potential issues.
They should download the [ethics form](ethics.docx) and type directly into that document.

Each group completes the document, and gets it provisionally approved by the TA - ideally before the workshop it over. Once they have provisional approval, they submit it to the module leader for formal approval. 

Most applications are likely to be innocuous, but here are the red-flag issues to look for: 

### Sample

Who are they planning to test? Does it involve any vulnerable groups, or involve collecting any sensitive data (e.g. sexual orientation)?

### Outline of procedure / detail of ethical concerns

Broadly, is there enough detail to be clear about what will happen?
The specific things they should cover are:

1. potential harms / risk (e.g. if they are doing anything that manipulates health in terms of exercise or diet, or if they are covering areas that may potentially "trigger" some people’s psychological distress).
1. Deceit. If so, what level of deceit and why is it necessary?
1. That consent is based on full information.
1. Anonymity is guaranteed (how will they do it)?

### The brief

Is there enough here to show that participants are able to give “informed” consent.

### The debrief

Is there enough here to explain why the study was run? We're not expecting a full literature-based account, just an overview of the experiment.

## Activity 2 (spare time if available)

The aim of this activity is to get the group to think through the practicalities of the study, so that they all run it in the same manner.

As long as they have a complete ethics form (that the TA is happy with), then they can start work on their materials. This involves:

1. The specific tests they plan to use.
1. The "script" that each experimenter will use with the participants.
1. If necessary, an agreed protocol for how they will collect and score their data.

Students often neglect the script, but this is crucial if they are all going to act as experimenters, to ensure that each of them runs the same experiment.  This seems obvious, but is as basic as whether they are testing people individually, or in groups, with their mobiles turned on or off (etc).

The data protocol applies if they are using behavioural outcome measures that they have to rate, or score,  such that there is a chance for different (or biased) ways of scoring. i.e. not for a standardised test.
For example, if it is a memory test, how will they deal with misspelt answers, or answers that are vague, or partially correct (etc).
