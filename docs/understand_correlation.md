# Understanding correlations

The aim of this workshop is to get them to understand more about correlations:

- What they look like
- How they are sensitive to outliers
- How they are insensitive to linear transformations (addition or multiplication)
- What a regression line means.

## Exercise 1

This is just to get them looking at scatterplots and correlations, but also to get them thinking about significance. I’m asking each group to run 10 iterations of correlations between 40 pairs of (random) scores. Some will be significant.

As a group, get them to discuss what this means (why does it happen, how should a significant effect be interpreted). Try to get them to move away from “proof”.

## Exercise 2

This is to get them thinking about the impact of scatterplots, and by virtue of this, looking at a plot of their data rather than just looking at the correlation value. They are asked to look at both the scatter plot, but also the distribution plot for each variable.
In the discussion, get them to appreciate the importance of care when entering data. E.g. a single repetition of a digit (inputting 55 instead of 5) can massively inflate correlations.

## Exercises 3 and 4

These are just demonstrations that correlations are insensitive to linear transformations. Effectively all this does is rescale the axes, but the distribution of points within those axes remains the same, hence the correlation remains the same. (Of course, the meaning of the slope and intercept will change).

## Exercises 5 and 6

These are demonstrations of the effects of transformations on slopes and intercepts, and so involve correlated variables.  (An advanced discussion point would be why the slopes don’t change in Exercises 3 and 4. This is because the slopes are effectively zero, and multiplying anything by zero is zero).

## Exercise 7

This is something different: this is a demonstration of the effect of summing noisy measures (on the correlation plot). Each score is weakly correlated to the true score, but as you add more measures together, so the noise is reduced and you get closer to the true score. This is shown in the stronger correlation values, and less "scatter" in the scatterplots.
