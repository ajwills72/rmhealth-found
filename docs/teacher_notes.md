_Teachers' notes_

## Overview

### Assessment

The module's mark is based on 60% Practical and 40% Test, with no exams, and no pass/fail components.

60% - Individual mark for a poster presentation. **Done in lecture in 12th week.**

40% - Individual mark for an online MCQ test. **Opens in Thursday of 11th week, closes Thursday of 12th week**. 

## 1st week

### Lecture 1

[Science, truth, and honesty](science_truth_honesty.pptx) (2 hour lecture). Module overview. Nature of knowledge and the scientific process. Nature of evidence in psychology, including normal distribution. Basics of ethical research. **AW.**

### Workshop 1

The aim of this workshop is to introduce the students to the idea that they will be designing a group project, and also to start the process of thinking about ethical issues. They are not expected to come up with a final topic, or a final design in this workshop. 

#### Activity 1 (10 mins) 

Get them to self-organise into groups of 6. Make sure these groupings include any absent students. (If they have a friend who is absent, get them to include them in their groups).  With 60 students in the current cohort, you should end up with 10 groups. If it's a choice between more groups, and larger groups, go for more groups. 

Tell them about the plans for a group project: they are going to have to come up with an idea for a study, and a method for their study in the coming weeks. But whatever they want to do has to be a) ethical, and b) practical.

Tell them also that in the coming lectures they will learn about different research methods, and that they don’t have to finalise choosing a topic until later in the module.

#### Activity 2 (20-30 mins)

Distribute (or show on screen) the first of the 3 research proposals, and get them to discuss (as a group) the ethical questions associated with it. Tell them to prepare to share their comments with the whole group.
After they have discussed the first, choose 2-3 groups to present their answers to the questions. Encourage a broader discussion between groups. (Do they agree / disagree? Are there other aspects to consider?)

Repeat the exercise for the next 2 proposals.  The key elements to bring out in the discussion are:

**Proposal 1**

- [Risky Extraversion Proposal](risky_extraversion_proposal.html)

- _Anonymity_: they are asking personal questions of people they know. Associated with this are issues of withdrawal, and appropriate brief and debrief.

- _Potential harm_: they are asking about potentially distressing topics. 

**Proposal 2**

- [Smoker Health Proposal](smoker_health.md)

- _Harm_: these are distressing images. Associated with this are issues of withdrawal, and appropriate brief and debrief.

**Proposal 3**

- [Music and Work Proposal](music_work.md)

- _Deception_: the task is impossible, but participants are not told. Associated with this are issues of withdrawal, and appropriate brief and debrief.

#### Activity 3 (20 mins)

Circulate the document [Choosing a design and topic for the group](choose_topic_design.docx). 
Talk the students through the 3 options.  Tell them they will learn more about the 3 methods in the lectures coming up. 

1. A correlational design.

2. A quasi-experimental design. This looks like an experiment, but doesn’t involve control over the independent variable.

3. An experimental design.

For now, get them to start thinking and discussing potential topics, and thinking about what the ethical challenges will be, and how they might overcome them (if possible). 

#### And the rest?

This seems to be only one hour of material for a two-hour workshop?

## 2nd week

### Lecture

[Personality and psychometrics](dummy.pptx) (2 hour lecture) - A lecture on personality and basics of psychometrics. This is new to 2024, being a combination of parts of two previous lectures (Sonja's week 2 lecture, Tim's week 3 lecture). _Not yet written_. **AW**.

### Workshop



## 3rd week

[Experiments and data](experiments_data.pptx) (2 hour lecture) - Experiments as manipulation. Independent and dependent variables. Ordinal, interval, and ratio measures. Noise and the need for statistics. Confounding variables. Between- versus within-subject designs. Counterbalancing and randomizing. Experimenter and instructional effects. Demand and expectancy effects. Problems with instructional manipulations, and solutions. Reducing noise. Noise versus generality. Quasi-experimental designs. Ceiling and floor effects. **AW**.

## 4th week

[Statistical inference](statistical_inference.pptx) (2 hour lecture) - Basics of probability. Multiplicative law. Type 1 and Type 2 errors. Cumulative probability. Sign test. Mann-Whitney test. One- and two-tailed tests. Correlation. **AW**. 

## 5th week

[More stats, and posters](stats_posters.pptx) (2 hour lecture) - _Stats_: Parametric and non-parametric tests. Sample size, effect size, and power. Statistical versus practical significance. Passing reference to Bayesian analysis. _Posters_: Scientific posters: Purpose. Title, Intro, Method, Results, Discussion. Non-text elements. Flow. **AW**. 

## 6th week

[Stress and coping](stress_coping.pptx) (2 hour lecture) - [Teacher's version with notes](stress_coping_notes.pptx) **MT**.

## 7th week

[Diet and weight management](diet_weight.pptx) (2 hour lecture) - [Teacher's version with notes](diet_weight_notes.pptx) **MT**.

## 8th week

[Exercise and physical activity](exercise.pptx) (2 hour lecture) - [Teacher's version with notes](exercise_notes.pptx) **MT**.

## 9th week

[Substance use and addiction 1](substance_addiction.pdf) (2 hour lecture) - [Teacher's version with notes](substance_addiction_notes.pptx). The editable versions of these materials are too large for this website, unless compressed. Here are the ZIP archives for [student version](substance_addiction.pptx.zip) and [teachers' verison](substance_addiction_notes.pptx.zip) **MT**. 

## 10th week

_Substance use and addiction 2_ (2 hour lecture) - Same materials as previous week. **MT**

## 11th week

[Poster presentations]() - In-class assessment (2 hours). **AW, MT**

## 12th week

Poster presentations are done, and MCQ is already open, so there seems little point teaching in 12th week.
