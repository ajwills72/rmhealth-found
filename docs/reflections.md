# Tutorial: Reflections

## Context and overview

This is the student’s last tutorial on the Foundation programme. In this tutorial, they'll reflect on their learning.

## Tutorial plan
 
### Checking-in

Students arrive, settle down, faff, etc. 
 
### Reflecting on the research project

Note 1: the students probably didn’t work in their tutorial groups for this, so there will be different experiences to contrast.

Note 2: Other than ex-circs cases, or no-shows, students should have presented their research  poster earlier in the week.

#### Lessons from conducting research

Get the group to discuss the key takeaway lessons they learned from conducting a piece of psychological research.  Get them to agree a list of 5 (or so) key "lessons" that they would give to next year’s students, or as a reminder to themselves when they run research later in the programme.

These can cover all aspects of running research, from designing materials, getting ethical clearance, collecting data, scoring data, analysis, to write-up. It can also involve general things like group working, time-management, inter-personal skills etc.

(Depending upon the success of the future.me activity which they may have done before this module started, this could be something they send to themselves in the future).

#### Lessons from Group Work

Get the group to reflect on their experience of running the research project as a group. Get them to agree a list of 3-5 advantages vs. 3-5 disadvantages of group work vs. working individually.

They can contrast their lists with that [here](https://blog.innerdrive.co.uk/advantages-disadvantages-group-work)

If there is time, you could ask them to discuss how they can maximise the advantages and minimise the disadvantages listed, e.g. techniques for overcoming conflict, or unequal participation etc.

### Reflecting on the year

This is the last foundation year tutorial. Have a chat with students about what they enjoyed and what they didn’t (i.e., reflection on the year).

In one of their first tutorials, some students may have sent themselves letters (using futureme.org). The letters (emails) should be arriving list week so it might be fun to read them and reflect.
Some students might be happy to read out their letters (or short extracts) to the group. Otherwise, give everybody some time to read individually and then lead some discussion:

- How does it feel to read the letters?
- Do you remember how you felt when you wrote them?
- Does it feel like a long time ago, or not so long?
- What are you proud of accomplishing this year?
- What would you like to work on for next year?
- Did you enjoy writing and receiving the letter / would you do it again?
- What are their plans for the summer?
- How are they feeling about starting Stage 1?
