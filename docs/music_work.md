1. _Group name, and names of all members of the group_: EXAMPLE PROPOSAL

2. _Project title_: Does upbeat music make people persevere at difficult tasks, compared to working in silence? 

3. _What target sample will you use, and how will you recruit them?_ We will recruit students currently registered on PSYC003, and we will recruit them face-to-face during workshop sessions. 

4. _Give a brief outline of your procedure:_ Participants will be told that they see a difficult “spot-the-difference” task, and they should find the 10 differences between the two images. In fact, there are only 5 differences. We will measure how long people are willing to keep trying to solve the task if they are working in silence, or with background music.
