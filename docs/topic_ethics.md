# Topic and ethics workshop

The aim of this workshop is to introduce the students to the idea that they will be designing a group project, and also to start the process of thinking about ethical issues. They are not expected to come up with a final topic, or a final design in this workshop. 

## Activity 1 

Get them to self-organise into groups of 6. Make sure these groupings include any absent students. (If they have a friend who is absent, get them to include them in their groups).  With 60 students in the current cohort, you should end up with 10 groups. If it's a choice between more groups, and larger groups, go for more groups. 

Tell them about the plans for a group project: they are going to have to come up with an idea for a study, and a method for their study in the coming weeks. But whatever they want to do has to be a) ethical, and b) practical.

Tell them also that in the coming lectures they will learn about different research methods, and that they don’t have to finalise choosing a topic until later in the module.

## Activity 2 

Distribute (or show on screen) the first of the 3 research proposals, and get them to discuss (as a group) the ethical questions associated with it. Tell them to prepare to share their comments with the whole group.
After they have discussed the first, choose 2-3 groups to present their answers to the questions. Encourage a broader discussion between groups. (Do they agree / disagree? Are there other aspects to consider?)

Repeat the exercise for the next 2 proposals.  The key elements to bring out in the discussion are:

**Proposal 1**

- [Risky Extraversion Proposal](risky_extraversion_proposal.html)

- _Anonymity_: they are asking personal questions of people they know. Associated with this are issues of withdrawal, and appropriate brief and debrief.

- _Potential harm_: they are asking about potentially distressing topics. 

**Proposal 2**

- [Smoker Health Proposal](smoker_health.md)

- _Harm_: these are distressing images. Associated with this are issues of withdrawal, and appropriate brief and debrief.

**Proposal 3**

- [Music and Work Proposal](music_work.md)

- _Deception_: the task is impossible, but participants are not told. Associated with this are issues of withdrawal, and appropriate brief and debrief.

## Activity 3 

Circulate the document [Choosing a design and topic for the group](choose_topic_design.docx).
Talk the students through the 3 options.  Tell them they will learn more about the 3 methods in the lectures coming up. 

1. A correlational design.

2. A quasi-experimental design. This looks like an experiment, but doesn’t involve control over the independent variable.

3. An experimental design.

For now, get them to start thinking and discussing potential topics, and thinking about what the ethical challenges will be, and how they might overcome them (if possible). 

## Extension

If they're done, they can move on to the next workshop.
