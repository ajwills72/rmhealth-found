# Questions

## For TAs

- Over 60 students on your own, how did that go?

- Some of the workshops seems to only have 1-hour of planned material? (1, 6 for sure, possibly also others)

- Workshop 2 seems a bit rubbish and esoteric. How long did it run, and how well did it go down?

- Workshop 3 seems to be on correlations, just most of the concepts only get introduced in the wek 4 lecture. How did that go? 

- 5th workshop (confounding variables, data quality) is one-hour only. Does TA realise this? How did that work?

- Workshop 9 seems to be on poster design, but I have no materials to support this? Do you? Also, it's only one hour.

## For Rob

- Stress and coping readings: Unclear. It's possible given the 'sources' section of Rob's slides that the lecture material is based on Carlson & Birkett (2017) _Physiology of Behaviour_, Chapter 17, section "Stress", but this is not cited.

- Substance abuse and addiction readings: Entirely unclear. Slides give no clues,
