**PSYC003 ethics form: Please complete all sections, expanding the space where necessary**. 			

1. _Group name, and names of all members of the group_: EXAMPLE PROPOSAL

2. _Project title_: Is extraversion related to the likelihood of engaging in unhealthy risk-taking behaviours?  

3. _What target sample will you use, and how will you recruit them?_ 
We will recruit students currently registered on PSYC003, and we will recruit them face-to-face during workshop sessions. 

4. _Give a brief outline of your procedure:_ Participants will first complete a standard personality assessment that includes a measure of introversion-extraversion, such as the EPI. We will then ask participants to complete a risk-taking survey that we have designed. For each question, people will rate how often they have engaged in risky health behaviours, using the scale “never, rarely, sometimes, regularly, all the time”. We will ask question such as “How often do you take part in dangerous sports or pastimes?”, “How often do you binge-drink alcohol?”, “How often do you take illegal drugs?”, and “How often do you drive over the speed limit?”, and “How often do you drive after drinking alcohol or taking drugs?”
