# Protocol and pilot workshop

The aim of this workshop is to get the students ready to collect their data.  

The main elements are:

1. To have a shared protocol (aka "script") that they will use when testing individually, to ensure that they test in a standardised fashion.

1. To have a shared protocol for scoring their data.

1. To pilot their procedures to see if anything needs tweaking prior to the proper data collection (e.g. participants don’t understand the task, produce data that can’t be analysed etc.).

## Activity Zero: Get ethical approval

(This is a reminder: don’t let groups get too bogged down in this, or they won’t be able to join in with the rest of the workshop).

This isn’t strictly part of the workshop, but there are groups who have not yet got ethical approval. A priority will be for those groups to get their application up to scratch and submitted.

## Activity 1


### Part 1: Protocol for running the study

The group need to develop a script for interacting with the participants. How are they going to explain the study? How are they going to get their volunteers to understand what they are going to do? How are they going to make sure the test environment is roughly equivalent? Will they allow their participants to ask questions before starting? Will there be a practice first? How will they ensure that their behaviour doesn’t influence the results? (etc).

The point is to get the students to understand that testing participants involves more than handing over a brief, then handing out the instructions.

The key reason for all this is standardisation. A method can’t be replicable if the different experimenters all used slightly different methods.

### Part 2: Protocol for scoring the data

The same point applies to scoring the data.

- How are responses going to be recorded?
- What constitutes a correct response vs an error?
- How will they deal with poor handwriting / spelling errors / approximate answers?
- In questionnaire studies, how will they deal with missing responses? (Note, they can’t add up the scale scores as if all answers were provided). Will they ask people to complete the missing items, or will they drop that person, or will they re-scale the values?

## Activity 2: Pilot, tweak

If the group has completed activity 1, then they can individually test members of another group (perhaps get groups to pair up). That way, they get experience trying out their protocol, but also experiencing another experiment.

The aim of this activity is to see what comes up as potential issues for standardisation if they pilot the study. Were the instructions clear? Did the participants have any questions? How did they answer those questions? Etc. Also, did they learn anything as a participant? Were the other groups instructions clearer?

The same applies to how they will treat their data. We want them to treat their data in a standardised way. (Could introduce the concept of inter-rater reliability as a form of reliability for the better groups).

Finally, I want them to notice if there are any potential data issues apparent in their pilot data. E.g. are there ceiling effects, floor effects, data outliers etc. If so, what do they plan to do before the experiment proper?

## Extensions

The next workshop ('understanding correlations') won't make much sense until they've had the lecture. So, it they're finished early, they can leave early.
