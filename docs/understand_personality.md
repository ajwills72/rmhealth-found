# Tutorial: Understanding personality

## Preparation

In advance of this tutorial, you must work out how you are going to distribute a set of ten personality statements to your tutees, such that no one sees what the others have received, and such that they believe the statements have been tailored to their personality. One option is to have sufficient hard copies to hand out in the tutorial, with each student's name at the top. 

## Context and overview

This tutorial supports a lecture on psychometrics, which has a focus on personality measures. In the tutorial, students will fill in questionnaires themselves and then attempt to evaluate their validity and design.

## Tutorial plan

### Checking-in

_5 minutes_

Students arrive, settle down, faff, etc. Say hello to them and ask them how they are, how they found their lectures etc.  

### Buzzfeed

_5-10 minutes_

- [An Accurate Personality Test](https://www.buzzfeed.com/audreyworboys/personality-quiz)  - Share this link.

- Ask students to fill it in (you could do the same to get a feel of the Qs)

- Share their thoughts on the questionnaire and results. Below are some suggested questions to ask:

  - Do they agree with the results?
  - Do they think it is a valid measure of personality?
  - Any comments on the question structure and overall design?
  - Any suggestions how to improve it? (Most psychology tests use a Likert or similar scale when using closed questions)

- Discuss the issue of personality "scales" vs personality "types".

### Open Psychometrics

_5-10 minutes_

- [What character are you?](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/)  - share this link. 

- Ask students to fill it in (again you could do the same to get a feel of the Qs and also could be useful to read the front page).

- Share their thoughts on the questionnaire and results. Below are some suggested questions to ask.

  - Do they agree with the results?
  - Do they think it is a valid measure of character?
  - Any comments on the question structure and overall design?
  - Any suggestions how to improve it and what do they think about the slider responses? Is it better than BuzzFeed test?
  - Might be worth reading "Is this test accurate?" at the end of the test.

### Self-evaluations of personality measures

_10 minutes_

- Give each of your tutees a printout of the 10 statements listed below under "Your Personality", preferably in a way that makes them think they are personalised to them. (You will need these printed in advance). THEY SHOULD NOT KNOW THAT THEY ARE ALL THE SAME. Tell them that you have printed off a set of 10 statements that you think describe them. Ask them to read them to see how many statements they agree with.

- Get them to share their thoughts on the how accurate they thought the descriptions were. How many statements did they agree with? How does this measure compare with the previous examples?

- Discuss the [Barnum effect](https://nesslabs.com/barnum-effect).Discuss with them the difference between self-evaluations of "fit" (i.e. the Barnum effect) as utilised in the discussions above, with the ability of a test to predict some aspect of behaviour.
Turn the discussion toward the concept of predictive validity (does variation in test score predict variability in a conceptually related behaviour). Try to get the students to articulate what this might look like (in terms of a scatterplot).

#### Your personality

_Personality assessment for_: INSERT STUDENT NAME

1. You have a great need for other people to like and admire you.
1. You have a tendency to be critical of yourself.
1. You have a great deal of unused capacity which you have not turned to your advantage.
1. While you have some personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them.
1. At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing.
1. You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations.
1. You pride yourself as an independent thinker and do not accept others' statements without satisfactory proof.
1. You have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others.
1. At times you are extroverted, affable, sociable, while at other times you are introverted, wary, reserved.
1.Some of your aspirations tend to be pretty unrealistic.

### Extraversion

_10 minutes_

[Extraversion test](https://www.psychologistworld.com/influence-personality/five-factor-test/extraversion-test)

This test is included as a contrast to the earlier measures, which attempt to classify people into "types". This is a continuous scale, and each student will fall somewhere along the scale.

Point out that such scores can be plotted against potential outcomes to create a scatterplot, with extraversion as the predictor, and another behaviour as the outcome. (You could even plot the group on a whiteboard / piece of paper, for a behaviour related to extraversion, such as impulsivity, morning-evening preference, social media use or something else). 

If there is time, discuss how scatterplots are evaluated (via correlation and lines of best fit). Don’t get bogged down in the weeds of statistics – just get the conceptual understanding.
